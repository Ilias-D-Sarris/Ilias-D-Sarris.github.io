# A little about me

I'm Ilias, a product manager with 10+ years of experience building successful B2B and B2C products. I'm skilled in leading cross-functional teams, conducting market research, defining product strategy, and managing the entire product lifecycle using Agile methodologies. I'm also experienced in leveraging AI tools for product management, including market analysis, customer feedback analysis, and process optimization.

Recently, I led the cloud transition of key SaaS products at GLS Fund Services, improving scalability and customer satisfaction. Before that, I was VP of IT Application Infrastructure at UBS PaineWebber, where I significantly improved project delivery by 80% and quality by 60%.

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in AI for business and data analysis, holding various product management, project management and financial certifications (including Google, IBM, and Coursera specializations, PMP, and Series 6, 7, 63).

I'm passionate about creating user-centric solutions and eager to contribute my expertise to a new challenge. I enjoy chess and film in my free time, and I am always looking for ways to learn and grow.
